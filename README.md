# Zomato-Frontend-Clone
The project I developed was a React-based front-end clone of Zomato, where I implemented key functionalities such as online food ordering, dining reservations, and user interaction flows (like mail/notifications). The goal was to recreate the look and feel of the Zomato platform with a scalable component architecture and responsive design.
